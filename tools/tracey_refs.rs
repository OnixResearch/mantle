// Mantle Tracey coverage bridge.
//
// Cairn's built-in tracey coverage rail currently scans `crates/` and `tools/`.
// Mantle's CLI/root-package implementation lives under top-level `src/`, so
// synced requirements implemented there need a small bridge until the coverage
// rail scans the package root directly.

// r[impl rust_package_planning.source_built_toolchain_closure]
// Implemented by `src/source_toolchain_closure.rs`, `src/cargo_free_self_build.rs`,
// `src/rust_plan.rs`, and `src/main.rs`.

// r[verify rust_package_planning.source_built_toolchain_closure]
// Verified by archived evidence in
// `cairn/archive/2026-05-31-source-built-toolchain-closure/evidence/` and focused
// unit tests under the root package modules named above.
