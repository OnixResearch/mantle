# Dependency audit policy

## Entry point

Run dependency audit from repo root with the checked-in policy:

```sh
SNIX_BUILD_SANDBOX_SHELL=/bin/sh nix develop -c cargo-deny check --config deny.toml
```

Root policy lives in `deny.toml`. Unconfigured cargo-deny output is not Mantle audit evidence.
Validate audit transcripts before citing them:

```sh
cargo -Zscript scripts/check-dependency-audit-evidence.rs <evidence.md>
```

The policy governs four audit classes:

- vulnerabilities
- unsoundness
- unmaintained crates
- yanked crates

License and source checks also run through the same entry point.

## Classification buckets

Current findings are classified into these buckets:

- **first-party actionable** — this repo controls the manifest, lockfile, or vendored workspace crate and should fix the finding before adding a waiver
- **transitive but tractable** — this repo does not own the direct manifest edge, but a lockfile update or compatible dependency bump from this repo can remove the finding
- **vendored or upstream-blocked** — the finding sits behind vendored code or an upstream crate choice that is not realistically fixable here without carrying a larger fork
- **dev-only or non-runtime** — the finding appears only in dev-dependencies, optional features not enabled in the shipped path, or other non-runtime exposure

| Finding | Crate(s) | Current classification | Current action |
|---|---|---|---|
| RUSTSEC-2026-0112 / RUSTSEC-2026-0113 / RUSTSEC-2026-0145 | `astral-tokio-tar` | fixed | bumped `vendor/snix-castore` to `astral-tokio-tar 0.6.3` |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0104 | `rustls-webpki` | fixed | bumped lockfile to `rustls-webpki 0.103.13` |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0194 / RUSTSEC-2026-0195 | `quick-xml` | upstream-blocked accepted waiver | latest `object_store 0.14.0` still caps `quick-xml` below the fixed 0.41 line |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0173 | `proc-macro-error2` | upstream-blocked accepted waiver | path is `oci-spec` -> `getset`; latest `oci-spec 0.10.0` still depends on `getset` |
| RUSTSEC-2023-0089 | `atomic-polyfill` | fixed | disabled default `postcard` features in vendored snix crates so `heapless 0.7` / `atomic-polyfill` are no longer in `Cargo.lock` |
| RUSTSEC-2024-0436 | `paste` | upstream-blocked accepted waiver | current path runs through `nickel-lang-core` |
| RUSTSEC-2023-0056 | `vm-memory` | resolved/no longer encountered | stale waiver removed after current audit reported no matching advisory criteria |
| RUSTSEC-2024-0002 | `vmm-sys-util` | resolved/no longer encountered | stale waiver removed after current audit reported no matching advisory criteria |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0204 | `crossbeam-epoch` | fixed | generated a targeted lock update from `0.9.18` to the compatible fixed `0.9.20`; no waiver added |
| license policy | `winx 0.36.4` | fixed policy gap | admitted only its declared `Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception` SPDX expression; crate license checks and confidence remain enabled |
| source policy | `nickel-export-core` | fixed policy gap | admitted only `https://github.com/OnixResearch/nickel-export`; Cargo/Nix/spec checks still enforce revision `257fafc1c746f1faf156207043a4c826bfb16d49` |

## Remaining waiver inventory

| Finding | Affected crate | Scope | Rationale | Review trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RUSTSEC-2024-0436 | `paste` | upstream-blocked transitive | path is `crunch-eval` -> `nickel-lang-core 0.16.1` -> `paste`; removing it requires a Nickel upstream release or a carried Nickel core migration | revisit when Nickel publishes a paste-free core release or Mantle intentionally carries that migration |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0173 | `proc-macro-error2` | upstream-blocked transitive build-time proc macro | path is `vendor/snix-build` -> `oci-spec 0.7.1` -> `getset 0.1.6` -> `proc-macro-error2`; latest checked `oci-spec 0.10.0` still uses `getset` | revisit when `oci-spec` removes `getset` or `getset` migrates away from `proc-macro-error2` |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0194 | `quick-xml` | upstream-blocked transitive | path is `vendor/snix-castore` -> `object_store 0.14.0` -> `quick-xml 0.40.1`; `object_store 0.14.0` pins below the fixed 0.41 line | revisit when `object_store` allows `quick-xml >= 0.41` |
| RUSTSEC-2026-0195 | `quick-xml` | upstream-blocked transitive | same `vendor/snix-castore` -> `object_store 0.14.0` -> `quick-xml 0.40.1` cap as RUSTSEC-2026-0194 | revisit when `object_store` allows `quick-xml >= 0.41` |

## Policy rules

- prefer real fixes over waivers when this repo can update the dependency safely
- keep waivers per finding and per crate, never as blanket class suppressions
- every remaining waiver must record scope, rationale, and a review trigger
- treat optional-feature or dev-only exposure differently from shipped runtime exposure, but document that distinction explicitly
- admit Git repositories individually and retain independent immutable-revision checks; repository admission does not authorize floating refs or arbitrary commits
- admit compound SPDX expressions exactly as declared and reviewed; do not replace license checks with crate-wide bypasses or lower confidence

## Claim boundary

A passing audit proves only that the resolved dependency graph satisfies the checked-in advisory, ban, license, and source policy against the advisory database available to that run. It does not prove dependency correctness, permanent absence of future advisories, legal suitability for every downstream distribution, trust in arbitrary commits from an admitted repository, or release eligibility.
