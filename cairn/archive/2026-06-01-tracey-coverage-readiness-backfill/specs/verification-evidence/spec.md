## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Tracey coverage readiness

r[verification_evidence.tracey_coverage_readiness] Mantle MUST maintain deterministic coverage traceability for accepted Cairn requirements before presenting release-readiness or archive-readiness claims that depend on Tracey coverage.

#### Scenario: accepted requirements have traceability disposition

GIVEN an accepted requirement exists under `cairn/specs/`
WHEN Tracey coverage readiness is evaluated
THEN the requirement MUST have either implementation/verification references, an evidence-backed bridge reference, or an explicit tracked debt disposition.
AND comment-only bridge references MUST cite inspected implementation paths or durable evidence before being counted as satisfying traceability.

#### Scenario: coverage failures stay bounded

GIVEN `cairn tracey coverage --root . --json` reports missing requirements
WHEN an agent or operator reports readiness status
THEN the report MUST include the exact coverage validity, referenced count, missing count, dangling count, and next missing group.
AND it MUST NOT claim global Tracey coverage is green unless the command reports `valid: true`.
